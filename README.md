# README

> Marketing Cloud Learning Apps are free to use but are not official Salesforce Marketing Cloud products and should be considered community projects. These apps are not officially tested or documented. For help on any Marketing Cloud Learning App, consult the Salesforce message boards or the issues section of this repository. Salesforce Marketing Cloud support is not available for these applications.

Make sure that you always use the latest version of the iOS MarketingCloudSDK. The Learning App only supports SDK versions 5.0.0 and above.
