/**
 ETPhoneHome is like a highway management system, governing the sending of data to and from Salesforce, and caching that which can't get sent home. It works by marshalling around GenericUpdate object subclasses, which themselves create a common pattern for handling business.
 
 Data should be sent back using phoneHome:, which will start the process of sending data to ET, and failing that, save it to the database. The behavior is all controlled by methods on the GenericUpdate object.

/**
 This is a clone of phoneHomeInBulkForGenericUpdateType and uses the same core functionality of it, however differs in the fact that we are passing in the PIEvent as an updateObject. This means we conditionally set the PIEvent table's claimed field based upon whether the passed in piEvent object's analyticType is a TrackView or TrackEvent to be deleted upon successful send. One additional important difference is that we are setting up the bulk as an array of dictionarys to be sent out as the phoneHomeInBulkForGenericUpdateType method does, but we will alyways send out only one element in the array. The reason for this is because we want to reuse the same inherited ETBulkUpdateShim block as a callback when we receive a successful server response without having to recreate all of this functionality.
