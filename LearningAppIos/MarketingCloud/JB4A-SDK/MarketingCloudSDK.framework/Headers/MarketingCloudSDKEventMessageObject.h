/**
 MarketingCloudSDKEventMessage is the local representation of a Message from Salesforce. They are multipurpose, sometimes representing a message that should be scheduled because of the entrance or exit of a Geofence, the proximal arrival to an iBeacon, or a CloudPage message downloaded from Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Because of their multipurpose nature, there are a lot of different attributes on them, many of which may be null at any give time depending on the type of message.
